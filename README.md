# Group_Project
Any one who is reading this, know that I did all the work. None of my group members bothered to do any work.
Instead they opted to ignore the work, and never bothered to read any of the commits I did for this site. I
hated working with them, as no one wanted to put in the effort of creating this site. They decided to leave
it till the last minute.
