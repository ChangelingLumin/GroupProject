				<p> .hack GU is in my opinion, one of the most criminally underrated gems for the Play Station 2. Combining both real-time strategy, and action RPG elements, to make a flawless hidden gem.
To say otherwise is an insult to gaming in general, and you owe it to yourself to play this game at least once.
The games story takes place in the year 2020, in Tokyo Japan. You play the character Haseo, a young man who recently purchased a virtual reality MMORPG called "The World R2". After being killed in game by a few Player Killers he then becomes a sort of vigilante that hunts down other Player Killers. Seven years later he meets up with a mysterious PK who goes by the name Tri-Edge. Who promptly reformats his PC while Haseo is still inside, causing Haseo to lose all progress he made in the seven years he played the game.
What transpires is a three game adventure through The World, as Haseo tries to get back the data he lost, while dealing with, government conspiracies, sentient computer viruses, comas, and a rouge AI hell bent on starting a nuclear war.
If you like insane plots, and depressing stories this is the game for you. 10/10

				Final Fantasy 12 isn’t for everyone. To say that this game differs from other Final Fantasy titles is an understatement. The games battle system takes place in real-time, as in the battles take place on the map, rather than on a separate screen, and you must utilize an advanced gambit system and a 3D plain in order to progress through each battle.
This game doesn’t have a class system like other Final Fantasy titles, instead it has a license system. In order to get licenses you must first get license points, then spend them on licenses through the license menu.
This game in my opinion has one of the most complex battle systems ever. Which adds to the complexity that is Final Fantasy 12.
The story takes place on the fictional world of Ivalice, during a civil war between Dalmasca and the Imperial forces. You play as six different characters as you try to piece together why the war started, and try to figure out how to stop it.
Vaan, a young boy who lost his older brother and parents to the war.
Penelope, a childhood friend of Vaan, who lost her parents in the war.
Vash, an ex-soldier who was charged with killing his king.
Asche, a princess who was dethroned during the war.
Baltheir, a sky pirate who is only interested in treasure.
Fran, a Veira companion of Baltheir.
8/10
